## Overview

The **Network-Intrusion-Detection-System** is designed to monitor and analyze network traffic patterns, accurately detecting and classifying malicious activities. This project involves developing a predictive model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate connections within a network, thereby enhancing the security posture of organizations by identifying potential threats in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously surveils network traffic to identify suspicious activities.
- **Accurate Detection:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to differentiate between normal and malicious connections.
- **Comprehensive Classification:** Classifies detected intrusions into predefined categories for better incident management.
- **Scalable Solution:** Designed to handle large volumes of network data efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from **The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition**, held in conjunction with **KDD-99**. It provides a robust foundation for training and testing the intrusion detection models.

### File Descriptions

- **`train.csv`**: The training set containing labeled network traffic data used to train the predictive model.
- **`test.csv`**: The test set containing unlabeled network traffic data used to evaluate the model's performance.
- **`Submit_sample.csv`**: A sample submission file illustrating the correct format for reporting the model's predictions.

## Getting Started
